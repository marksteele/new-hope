# DEPRECATED

Fork of new-hope

This software is a simple AMQP to Esper gateway (and back).

The software expects an AMQP exchange to which data is published and binds a 
queue to it.

When messages are received, they are parsed and sent into Esper for processing.

When Esper has an output (based on configured queries), it will emit a message 
to an AMQP exchange.

Changes from original:
 - Uses AMQP instead of ZeroMQ
 - Handles multiple inputs per AMQP message


This is part of a larger effort to build a truly scalable monitoring infrastructure 
that has best of breed open source components.

Known bugs:

Probably lots. I am a complete ruby/java novice.

I'm probably using ruby/eventmachine/amqp/something wrong as for some reason if 
nothing is publishing to amqp to the input queue, messages aren't sent out on 
the output exchange. If there's a steady stream of input to the queue, things 
are published in a timely manner.
