Fork of new-hope

This software is a simple AMQP to Esper gateway (and back).

The software expects an AMQP exchange to which data is published and binds a queue to it.

When messages are received, they are parsed and sent into Esper for processing.

When Esper has an output (based on configured queries), it will emit a message to an AMQP exchange.

Changes from original:
 - Uses AMQP instead of ZeroMQ
 - Handles multiple inputs per AMQP message


This is part of a larger effort to build a truly scalable monitoring infrastructure that has best of breed open
source components.
